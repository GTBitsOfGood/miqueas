# Miqueas
We are building a inventory management solution for the non-profit Miqueas 6.8. Miqueas 6.8 is a non profit that operates a children's home for kids without family support. They store school supplies and other materials for the children, but they need a way to keep track of them. Thus we are building an inventory management system for them to help better manage their supplies.

# Progressive Web App
One of the main challenges for this project is that the webapp needs to work offline. Progressive webapps are a solution to this problem, as they allow webapps to persist without connection to the internet. Google has a list of [standards](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) that they use to qualify a webapp as persistent. This app is also designed to work on mobile devices, which is part of progressive webapp standards.
